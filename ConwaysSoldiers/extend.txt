Extended Version


I have used a novel data structure to store every possible ancestor-chain of each board.
My program will find every possible route to the target and then let the user chose which to view in 
a menu system. The menu works better with some text to explain the choices, however I realised SDL_ttf 
(the extened SDL library needed for text) was not installed on the lab machines, so I have also made 
a purely colour based version. Both are included, if you wish to try it with the ttf you can set enable ttf 
in the graphics window.
